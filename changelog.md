### b_0.3 - Current version (07/05/2021)

- First release of the new rewrite, now with commands neatly filed away as node modules instead of being run via eval() on plain text. 
- Added most commands of the previous versions.
- Hopefully the last rewrite
- Switched markov related stuff from small snippets dotted everywhere to the newly finished markov js module.
- Outsourced command handling to a separate module
- Added "Guild" module to handle guild specific tasks
- Added "User" module to handle user specific tasks
- Added "Rollout" to apply updates to the guild settings globally.
- Added various repetitive functions in the "Utility" module.
- Added active opt-in approach for markov learning
- Added "superadmin" commands


### b_0.2 - No longer available (never released, rather)

Previous versions of the bot using a completely different approach to basically everything. Horribly inefficient and frankly disgusting to read.
